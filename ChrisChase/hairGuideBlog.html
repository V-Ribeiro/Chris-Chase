When it gets too oily, it can lead to the appearance of dandruff. Regularly exfoliating your scalp will help get rid of these flakes and ease your anxiety over their existence, as well as preventing hair loss and hair thinning. The hair products you are using can stay caught in your scalp and end up clogging your hair follicles.

For colored hair, it can help you enhance the vibrancy of your hair. It can also fixes frizzy, damaged, dry hair, or ensure fast hair growth but you have to figure out which type of mask works best for your type of hair. For example, if you have an oily scalp paired with dry ends, you may have to use different types of masks for the different parts of your hair to achieve maximum result. <BR/>\n        <BR/>\n        <IMG class=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"images/blogs/weeklyhairGuide/Hair guide 3.jpg\" alt=\"Hands holding a pot of white cream\"/> <BR/>\n        <BR/>\n        <B><I>4.
